This plugin will generate a Shortcode for Listing Activity Streams, Members, and Groups on any post/page on the website.

== Description ==

This plugin will add an extended feature to BuddyPress. It will use Shortcode for Listing Activity Streams, Members directory, and Groups directory on any post/page within the website.
